# GOOGLE STOCK PREDICTION

This repository demonstrates the use of TensorFlow to predict Google's stock prices. It starts by gathering historical stock data from Yahoo Finance, followed by a thorough data cleaning and preparation process to ensure high-quality inputs for the model.

The dataset is then split into training and testing sets. A Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network is used, which is well-suited for time series prediction. The LSTM network is trained to learn patterns in Google's stock data, enabling it to forecast future price movements.

The model’s performance is evaluated using Mean Squared Error (MSE), a metric that measures how closely the predicted values match the actual stock prices.

This project offers a detailed, step-by-step guide to stock market prediction, combining data science and advanced neural networks. It’s an insightful resource for those interested in financial prediction and AI-driven analysis.
